# Profiles of home learning environments 

A **cluster analysis** of families' **early math** practices, including math-related conversations and activities. This is my <font color="#8c7edc">**dissertation**</font> project, in which I am also **classifying** families into clusters based on various cognitive, affective, and socioeconomic factors and using these derived clusters to **predict children's academic skills**. 

This project <font color="#8c7edc">extends my previous work</font>, a **cluster analysis** of dyadic interactions using various **language input** measures. [<a href="Duong_CogTalk_Nov21_NumberClusters_Slides.pdf">Slides for <i>Pitt Cognitive Talk Series</i></a>] [<a href="DuongEtAl-2022_CDS.pdf">Poster for <i>Cognitive Development Society Meeting</i></a>]

# Dynamic structures of social interactions

A visual and quantitative analysis of **dyadic interactions** between caregivers and children using **cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA)**. Specifically, this project extracts additional measures of interactions beyond frequencies of input (e.g., words, utterances), such as the presence and duration of **reciprocal** exchanges. 

[<a href="https://github.com/s-duong/crqa-number-talk">Analysis code + Tutorial</a>] [<a href="Duong_CogTalk_Nov22_CRQA_Slides.pdf">Slides for <i>Pitt Cognitive Talk Series</i></a>] [<a href="">Journal article (under review)</a>]

There are several parts:

- Chronological **literature review** on the application of CRQA in early language research.
- **Case study** and **tutorial** of CRQA on existing transcription data of dyadic conversations about numbers and math.
- **Qualitative analysis** comparing frequency and CRQA measures of conversations and a **quantitative analysis** of the relations between input measures and children's academic skills.

# High cognitive demand questions

A multi-study project with 2 aims: 

- Explore **links** between children's exposure to caregivers' high (vs. low-) cognitive demand (CD) **questions** in the home learning environment and children's **early academic skills**. [<a href="">Analysis code</a>] [<a href="DuongEtAl-2021_JECP.pdf">Journal article</a>] 
- Investigate caregiver and child **factors** that **predict high-CD questioning**. [<a href="">Analysis code</a>] [<a href="">Journal article (under review)</a>]

# Uncertainty resolution and numbers

<!-- MIGHT REMOVE here for variety though! -->

An **eye-tracking** study of adults' switching frequency during **numerical comparisons** and their **math skills**. In general, people who tend to **switch** between targets **more often** in a numerosity comparison task generally **perform better**, particularly if they have **high math** ability.
