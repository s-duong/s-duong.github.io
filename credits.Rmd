This website was built in **R Markdown** with <span class="badge bg-primary">R</span>, <span class="badge bg-primary">HTML</span>, <span class="badge bg-primary">CSS</span>, and <span class="badge bg-primary">Javascript</span>. Here are some (but not all) tools that I used:

- This <a href=https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html>section</a> of the definitive R Markdown guide which helped me get started!
- The <a href=https://bootswatch.com/flatly/>flatly theme</a> from Bootswatch
- <a href=https://fontawesome.com/>Font Awesome's</a> website icons which appear at the top right corner of my navigation bar (e.g., email, LinkedIn)
- The <a href=https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aniview/index.html>'aniview'</a> R package to animate the entrance of text
- I Googled A LOT!
