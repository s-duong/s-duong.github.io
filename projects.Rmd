# Profiles of home learning environments 

A **cluster analysis** of families' **early math** practices, including math-related conversations and activities. This is my <font color="#8c7edc">**dissertation**</font> project, in which I am also **classifying** families into clusters based on various cognitive, affective, and socioeconomic factors and using these derived clusters to **predict children's academic skills**. 

This project <font color="#8c7edc">extends my previous work</font>, a **cluster analysis** of dyadic interactions using various **language input** measures. [<a href="Duong_CogTalk_Nov21_NumberClusters_Slides.pdf">Slides for <i>Pitt Cognitive Talk Series</i></a>] [<a href="DuongEtAl-2022_CDS.pdf">Poster for <i>Cognitive Development Society Meeting</i></a>]

# Dynamic structures of social interactions

A visual and quantitative analysis of **dyadic interactions** between caregivers and children using **cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA)**. Specifically, this project extracts additional measures of interactions beyond frequencies of input (e.g., words, utterances), such as the presence and duration of **reciprocal** exchanges. This work is a <font color="#8c7edc"><b>collaboration</b></font> with <a href="https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/davtj">Tehran Davis</a> at the University of Cinncinati.  

[<a href="https://github.com/s-duong/crqa-number-talk">Analysis code + Tutorial</a>] [<a href="Duong_CogTalk_Nov22_CRQA_Slides.pdf">Slides for <i>Pitt Cognitive Talk Series</i></a>] [Journal article (under review)]

There are a few parts:

- Chronological **literature review** on the application of CRQA in early language research.
- **Case study** and **tutorial** of CRQA on existing transcription data of dyadic conversations about numbers and math.
- **Qualitative analysis** comparing frequency and CRQA measures of conversations and a **quantitative analysis** of the relations between input measures and children's academic skills. 

<b>The overarching goal of this project was to find computationally-inexpensive ways to uncover additional conversational patterns in existing data for the purposes of (1) enhancing scientific knowledge on language and learning, (2) optimizing data reuse within the <a href=https://lrdc.pitt.edu/ppel/>Parents Promoting Early Learning Study</a>, and (3) sharing this method with researchers.</b>

# Exploration, uncertainty, and numerical judgements

An **eye-tracking** study of **exploratory behavior**, i.e., eye switching frequency, during **numerical comparisons** and math skills in **children** [<a href="https://github.com/s-duong/exploration-eyetracking-ans/blob/main/Final_Project_Duong.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>] and **adults** [<a href="Duong_Fall2020_CMU_BrainBag.pdf">Slides for <i>CMU Brain Bag</i></a>] [<a href="DuongLibertus-2020_JDM.pdf">Poster for <i>Judgement and Decision Making Conference</i></a>]

# EDA city over here

I have conducted exploratory data analysis in many courses. Below are 3 of my favorite EDA reports. I had the most fun working on them for various reasons (e.g., I got to choose a personally interesting dataset, I was learning something new and exciting). **I always write my reports in a (kind of) tutorial style as this helps me (and hopefully others) learn!**

- Text sentiment-derived features from sales representatives’ reports of customer interactions [<a href=Duong_Shirley_Final_01_Data_Exploration.html>HTML of R Markdown</a>]
- <a href=https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-07-30>Video games dataset</a> from TidyTuesday [<a href=Duong_Shirley_Midterm_df2.html>HTML of R Markdown</a>]
- Mysterious dataset provided by the instructor, a chance to use the **Seaborn** library (since I prefer ggplot2 🙂) [<a href=Duong_Shirley_Midterm_df1_python.html>HTML of Juypter Notebook</a>]

# High cognitive demand questions

A multi-study project with 2 aims: 

- Explore **links** between children's exposure to caregivers' high (vs. low-) cognitive demand (CD) **questions** in the home learning environment and children's **early academic skills**. [<a href="">Analysis code</a>] [<a href="DuongEtAl-2021_JECP.pdf">Journal article in <i>Journal of Experimental Child Psychology</i></a>] 
- Investigate caregiver and child **factors** that **predict high-CD questioning**. [<a href="">Analysis code</a>] [Journal article (under review)]
