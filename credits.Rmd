This website was built in **R Markdown** mostly in **HTML**. Here are some (but not all) tools that I used:

- This <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html">section</a> of the definitive R Markdown guide which helped me get started!
- The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bootswatch.com/flatly/">flatly theme</a> from Bootswatch
- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome's</a> website icons which appear at the top right corner of my navigation bar (e.g., email, LinkedIn)
- The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aniview/index.html">'aniview'</a> R package to animate the entrance of text
- I Googled A LOT! 🙇🏻‍♀️
