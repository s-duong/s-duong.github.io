# About Me


## Currently, I am a...

ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ **Data analyst** at [Trying Together](https://tryingtogether.org/), a non-profit organization supporting the work of early childcare and education.

ðŸ’»ðŸ“š **PhD candidate** in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh working with [Melissa Libertus](https://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/people/researcher-detail.cshtml?id=530). My research focuses on:

-   Links between children's **early math** experiences in the **home learning environment (HLE)** and the development of their math skills.
-   Applying **new methods** (i.e., behavioral coding and statistical modeling) to measuring the HLE, particularly **interactions** between children and their caregivers.
